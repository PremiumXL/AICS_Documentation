# Daily Ticket Reassignment

## Overview

The `daily_ticket_reassignment` function is designed to reassign support tickets among available agents based on their availability and current workload. It ensures that tickets are distributed efficiently each day, taking into account the dynamic nature of agent availability.

## Key Features

- **Daily Reassignment**: Automatically reassigns tickets to agents at the start of each day.
- **Availability Check**: Considers real-time availability of agents to ensure tickets are only assigned to those who are available.
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes tickets evenly among agents based on their current workload.
- **Bulk Update**: Efficiently updates ticket assignments in bulk to minimize database operations.
- **Scalability**: Capable of handling a large number of tickets and agents.

## Workflow

1. **Initialization**:
    - Configures the Django environment and prepares subqueries for checking agent availability.
  
2. **Agent Fetching**:
    - Retrieves a list of agents with the `AGENT` role and annotates them with their availability and the number of tickets currently assigned.
  
3. **Ticket Fetching**:
    - Fetches all tickets that are in the 'Response Needed' status, regardless of their current assignment.

4. **Ticket Reassignment**:
    - If more than one agent is available, tickets are reassigned in a round-robin fashion to ensure an even distribution.
    - If only one agent is available, tickets are reassigned to this agent, avoiding reassignment of tickets already assigned to them.

5. **Logging**:
    - Logs the completion of the ticket reassignment process.

## Use Cases

- **Daily Operations**:
    - Ensures that tickets are reassigned to available agents each day, taking into account changes in agent availability.

- **Load Balancing**:
    - Balances the workload among support agents, preventing any single agent from becoming overwhelmed with tickets.

- **Dynamic Availability Handling**:
    - Adapts to the dynamic nature of agent availability, ensuring tickets are not assigned to agents who are unavailable.

## Benefits

- **Efficiency**:
    - Streamlines the ticket reassignment process, ensuring that tickets are handled promptly and by the most appropriate agents.

- **Scalability**:
    - Handles a large number of tickets and agents, making it suitable for organizations with significant support operations.

- **Real-time Adaptability**:
    - Adapts to real-time changes in agent availability, ensuring optimal ticket distribution.

## Integration

The `daily_ticket_reassignment` function integrates seamlessly with existing support systems. It uses Django models for managing tickets and agents and can be scheduled to run at the start of each day to ensure tickets are reassigned based on the latest agent availability.

## Example Scenarios

1. **Scenario 1: Daily Reassignment**:
    - At the start of each day, the function reassigns tickets to ensure all available agents have an even workload, adapting to any changes in agent availability.

2. **Scenario 2: Dynamic Agent Availability**:
    - If an agent becomes unavailable, the function dynamically adjusts the ticket assignments, redistributing tickets to available agents.

3. **Scenario 3: Load Balancing**:
    - Ensures that no single agent is overwhelmed by tickets, distributing them evenly based on current workloads.

## Conclusion

The `daily_ticket_reassignment` function is a robust solution for managing the daily reassignment of support tickets in a dynamic and scalable manner. By automating the reassignment process and ensuring balanced workloads, it enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of support operations.
